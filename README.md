toolkit
=======

A box of tools for jumpstarting VM's.


A little bit of why?
====================

To relieve the pain of spinnin up new vm's and other machines.  Never have to reconfigure a development environment for all your precious keystrokes and shortcuts that make you feel all warm inside again.  While working at my last internship, I was inspired to automate the process and its been saving me a lot of headaches ever since.
