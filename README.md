My Box of Tools for jumpstarting VM's and foreign machines.


A little bit of why?
====================

If you are ever dealing with server mainenance, local-development boxes, or just enjoy ssh you know how much of a pain in the behunda it is to have to reconfigure your development environment so that you have all your precious keystrokes, shortcuts, and plugins that make you feel all warm inside.  While working at my last internship, I was inspired by wilkystyle to automate the process and it saved me a lot of heart ache in the long run.

   To Install (Sorry, if you run windows you are on your own)
==================
- Clone this repo to your home directory on your linux or other unix based machine..
- cd into the toolkit directory
- Run ./make_links.sh
   -- Note: You may have to change file permissions on make_links.sh i.e. 'chmod 755 make_links.sh'
- Enjoy
